# Marta Borawska
I've decided to change my professional life and enter the IT world. 
I graduated from postgraduate studies - Software Tester where I gained knowledge about software development and testing process, tests management, test automation and commercially used testing tools.
Currently, I am working on a crowdsourcing platform - uTest. I carry out functional tests for web and mobile apps. I've learned how to prepare clear bug reports and reviews for tested apps. In the meantime, I also develop my skills and knowledge by participating in webinars and courses. 
Previously, I was working for almost 4 years as a Product Engineer in the biggest Polish EMS provider. I gained experience in working with documentation and customer requirements. I was responsible for preparing production and test documentation. My daily tasks required working with tools: JIRA and Confluence. I was in constant contact with developers, reporting bugs in ERP systems and proposing new features.
